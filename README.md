# Galvanize Capstone 1 Project

### Topic (Title): Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction

#### High level description of project:
The COVID-19 novel coronavirus has been written about ad nauseum in the media, but it is sometimes hard to separate the truth from the fear-mongering or false assurances of safety.  Questions that I would like to know are: What are some data quality issues that could be affecting current coronavirus case reporting?  Can we prove at a 95% confidence level, that the mortality rate for a 20-30 year old male in Texas is higher for the coronavirus than the flu or other diseases?  Can we predict spreading as a result of population density and preventative measures like lockdowns or curfews?
