#### High level description of project:
Where is the best place to buy an Airbnb for a real estate investor in Austin?  How do we go about solving this problem?

First, we want to compare the real estate market for Austin to different places around the world.  This will give us an idea of how good the Austin market looks in terms of Airbnb investment as compared to other cities.
- Possible Hypothesis - Austin is no better than Portland, Seattle, DC, Boston, San Francisco, Nashville, New Orleans, Denver, Asheville for Airbnb Rental Prices vs. Price per sqft for sold houses vs. Alternate Hypothesis that it is

listings2 df:
- Had to use unzip to get data
- used regular expressions to extract bathrooms from text

Next, we will want to compare zip codes in Austin and determine which are the best zip codes
- We will need to estimate revenue based on price and availability
- We can also just look at price per bed or per bed/bath to determine where the prices are the highest
- We can look at the relationship between price per bed and availability for different zip codes
